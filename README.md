# Wello.

This web application was created as a project for the *User Interface Programming* course at FIT BUT.
The goal of it was to get familiar with the process of creating a proper user interface, together with 
the research, implementation and testing phases.

This particular project is focused on creating a rough sketch of a web application for managing user's mental health.
One can write daily prompts, explore inspirational quotes, meditate, and observe the trends in development of his or hers mood,
together with reasons causing the extremes in emotions.
